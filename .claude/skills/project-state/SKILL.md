# project-state

Deterministic status. Zero AI does the measuring; you add a two-line human read on top.

## Steps

1. Run `./scripts/state.sh` and, if a quick health read is wanted, `./scripts/gate.sh`.
2. Summarize in ≤3 lines: branch/dirty/ahead-behind, gate colour, and the newest HANDOFF *Next*.

Do not re-derive anything the scripts already print. Surface the numbers plus what they mean.
